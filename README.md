# Status

It works with tons of glue patching everywhere ...

## Roadmap

  * Finalize CRUD operations for db and in-memory regardings jobs/workers/workloads
  * When works will come with their own libs and stuff, will need to shift the focus from "one exec" to one a zip containing exec + libs.
  * No idea right now concerning timeouts of tcp sockets.
  * Find a more elegant way to handle the new jobs request, going through kaazing works but ...
  * Tons of more stuff
